# 🚀 NeuroFlow Architect

**A high-performance, visual AI workflow builder designed for rapid prototyping and code generation.**

**[Live Demo](https://toudaimori.github.io/neuroflow-architect/)**

---

## 💡 Overview

**NeuroFlow Architect** is a developer-centric tool for designing AI agent workflows and RAG pipelines. It provides a visual canvas to build complex logic and instantly exports it as structured JSON schemas or boilerplate Python code, bridging the gap between design and implementation.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Visual Workflow Builder:** Drag-and-drop interface for architecting directed graphs using React Flow.
* **Execution Simulation:** Custom BFS-based engine to visualize data flow and node transitions.
* **Dual-Format Export:**
* **JSON Schema:** Clean, adjacency-list structures for backend integration.
* **Python (LangChain):** Ready-to-use boilerplate code for rapid development.


* **Node-Level Configuration:** Fine-tune LLM parameters and data settings directly on the canvas.
* **Modern Stack:** Optimized for performance with **Vite**, **Zustand**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.
